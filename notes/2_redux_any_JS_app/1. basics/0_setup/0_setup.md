# Getting Started with redux library

- we'll see how redux works in any Javascript app, here we are not considering any React Apps in particular.

## 1. installation :

- node, npm : download node from web, npm comes by default with node.

## 2. project setup

- create a folder to initialize the project, and install redux library

```zsh
# initialize node project
npm init -y

# install redux library
npm i redux
```

## 3. Starting with redux application

- create index.js (starting point of app)
