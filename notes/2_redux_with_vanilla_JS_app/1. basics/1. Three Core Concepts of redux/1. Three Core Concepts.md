# Three Core Concepts of redux :

1. Store : A store that holds the state of your application.
2. Action : An action that describes the changes in the state of the application.
3. Reducer : A reducer which actually carries out the state transition depending on the action.

## Scenario :

- If we want to open a cake shop
- then here 3 entities are involved i.e shop, customer and shopkeeper
  - shop(to store all the cakes) => store
  - customer(have intension to buyCakes) => Action
  - shopkeeper(who handles customer's buyCake request) => Reducer
