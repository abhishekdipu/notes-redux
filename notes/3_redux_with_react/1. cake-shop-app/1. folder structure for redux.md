## folder structure for redux

- there is no specific/fixed way to create this. so can be structured as per choice/requirement.
- here we'll follow a simple one

## steps to create initial boilerplate code:

### 1. create parent folder

- create a folder "redux" in src

### 2. create feature folder

- now inside redux folder we'll create folders by diff features, here we are selling cake only, so create a folder by name "cake"

### 3. define actionTypes

- in src/redux/cake/cakeTypes.js create a file "cakeTypes.js" to define actionTypes

```js
export const BUY_CAKE = "BUY_CAKE";
```

### 4. define actionCreator

- in src/redux/cake/cakeActions.js" create a file "cakeActions.js" to define actionCreator

```js
import {BUY_CAKE} from "./cakeTypes";

export const buyCake = () => {
  return {
    type: BUY_CAKE,
  };
};
```

### 4. create reducer

- in src/redux/cake/cakeReducer.js create a file "cakeReducer.js" to define reducer function

```js
import {BUY_CAKE} from './cakeTypes'

const initialState = {
  numOfCakes: 10,
};
const cakeReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch(action.types){
        case BUY_CAKE : return{
            ...state,
            numOfCakes= state.numOfCakes-1
        }
        default: return state
    }
};

export default cakeReducer;
```

### 5. create store

- in src/redux/store.js create a file "store.js" to define reducer function

```js
import {createStore} from "redux";
import cakeReducer from "./cake/cakeReducer";

const store = createStore(cakeReducer);

export default store;
```

### 5. provide store to app component of react

- provide the store to all component of application so for that in src/App.js

```js
import "./App.css";
import {CakeContainer} from "./components/CakeContainer";
import {Provider} from "react-redux";
import store from "./redux/store";
function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <div className="App">
        <CakeContainer />
      </div>
    </Provider>
  );
}

export default App;
```
