## how do we subscribe to store and dispatch action from react app.

- this is done in 3 simple steps

## 1. define a function mapStateToProps

- this is to map store states to props
- this function accepts state as parameter and returns Object

```js
// src/components/CakeContainer.js
const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    numOfCakes: state.numOfCakes,
  };
};
```

- it's also called selector
- A “selector” is simply a function that accepts Redux state as an argument and returns data that is derived from that state.

## 2. define a function mapDispatchToProps

- this is to map dispatch actions to props
- this function accepts dispatch method as parameter and returns Object

- Convension : create a index.js in src/redux folder and export all actionCreators from there.

```js
// src/redux/index.js
export {buyCake} from "./cake/cakeActions";
```

```js
// src/components/CakeContainer.js
import {buyCake} from "../redux";

const mapDispatchToProp = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    buyCake: () => dispatch(buyCake()),
  };
};
```

## 3. connect these 2 functions (mapStateToProps + mapDispatchToProps)

- for this we user connect HOC(higher order component) to connect this 2 functions

```js
import {connect} from "react-redux";
export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProp)(CakeContainer);
```

## Use step :

- after these 3 steps now "CakeContainer" will have "numOfCake" and "buyCake" props in addition of other props which it'll receive.
- so can be used to display numOfCake and buyCake can be used as clickHandler

```js
const CakeContainer = (props) => {
  console.log(props);
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Number of cake - {props.numOfCakes}</h2>
      <button onClick={props.buyCake}>Buy cake</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
